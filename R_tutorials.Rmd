##3.2.4 Exercises

1)Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg)
```

Ans: No graph plot shown.

2)How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r dimension mpg}
dim(mpg)
```
Ans : 234 rows and 11 coloumns.

3)What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

```{r}
?mpg
```

Ans :f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd (what drive the car is )

4)Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

1st code :
```{r}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy,y=cyl))+geom_point()
```

2nd Code:
```{r}
ggplot(mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x=hwy,y=cyl))
```



5)What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?


```{r}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=class,y=drv))+geom_point()
```

Ans: The plot is not useful as the variables used are categorical variables.
